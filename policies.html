Sitting against hallway walls is not permitted at any time.</p>

			<p>11. Locals, tourists, and others not involved in the convention will naturally be curious about the convention and its attendees. Treat these individuals with courtesy and respect. Our convention has an excellent reputation in the city of San Antonio because of our excellent attendees.</p>
